# Engineering Interview Challenge

## Overview

The goal of this challenge is to design a system that can be used to implement a double materiality analysis. While it's not needed to have a working solution, it's important that you have a plan for how to implement the system and are able to explain the tradeoffs of your design.

## Requirements

- Requirement analysis;
- System Architecture diagram;
- Example code for the system - even pseudo code is fine but preferance for a sample implementation - can be using mock data as long as it's clear how it would be used in a real-world scenario;
- Tradeoffs;
- Assumptions;
- Constraints;
- Risks;

## Submission

Please fork this repository and submit a pull request with your solution - it should contain the following:

- A README.md file with your solution - referring to the requirements, domain and providing a clear explanation of your design;
- A system_design.md file with your system design and with diagrams;
- A code_example.md or actual code file with your code example of how to use the system - be it from an API, a CLI, or a UI;

## Disclaimer

There's no right or wrong answer here - this is an opportunity to show us how you think and how you would approach a problem - in this case, a double materiality analysis, which is a core component of our system capabilities.
